                <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy working on personal coding projects, tackling coding challenges, and experimenting with UI prototypes. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to UI/UX design because it combines creativity with functionality, allowing me to craft user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. Participating in hackathons and exploring emerging technologies constantly fuels my growth and problem-solving skills.</p>

                <p>In my downtime, I love getting lost in novels and manhwas, which expose me to a wide range of worlds, ideas, and perspectives. Whether it's a gripping mystery or an imaginative sci-fi story, reading helps me relax and boosts my creativity. It's my way of balancing logic-driven work with imaginative thinking.</p>

                <p>Outside of tech and literature, Iâ€™m passionate about gaming, photography, and music. Gaming sharpens my strategic thinking and offers a fun escape, while photography lets me express creativity through a visual lens. Music plays a key role in my life, serving as both a source of comfort and creative energy.</p>
